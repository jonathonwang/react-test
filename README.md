### How To Use

`gulp` runs default tasks
`gulp watch` watches files for changes and runs appropriate tasks
`gulp --production` runs default tasks and minifies files without sourcemaps and gives the files `.min.*` extensions

Take a look at the `gulpfile.babel.js` to see you you could use this in your project.
