# React Gulp TSX (WIP)

React TSX Playground

### Install

Clone this repo and cd into the directory.

Then run:
`npm install gulp -g`
`npm install`
`typings install`

---

### How To Use

`gulp` runs default tasks
`gulp watch` watches files for changes and runs appropriate tasks
`gulp --production` runs default tasks and minifies files without sourcemaps and gives the files `.min.*` extensions

Take a look at the `gulpfile.babel.js` to see you you could use this in your project.
